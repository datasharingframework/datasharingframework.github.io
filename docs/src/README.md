The HiGHmed Data Sharing Framework (HiGHmed DSF) implements a distributed process engine based on the BPMN 2.0 and FHIR R4 standards. Within the HiGHmed medical informatics consortium, the DSF is used to support biomedical research with routine data. Every participating site runs a FHIR endpoint (dsf-fhir) accessible by other sites and a business process engine (dsf-bpe) in the local secured network. Authentication between sites is handled using X.509 client/server certificates. The process engines execute BPMN processes in order to coordinate local and remote steps necessary to enable cross-site data sharing and feasibility analyses. This includes access to local data repositories, use-and-access-committee decision support, consent filtering, and privacy preserving record-linkage and pseudonymization.
