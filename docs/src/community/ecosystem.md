We believe that the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) can only develop its full potential when embedded in a well-connected network of tools, organizations, and individuals.

We appreciate the contributions of everyone who supports this shared approachâ€”whether by directly advancing the DSF or by developing and applying tools that make use of it in various contexts.

Your expertise and ongoing efforts are an essential part of this broader ecosystem.
