## Funded Partners

### Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences | Gecko Institute
The [GECKO Institute](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/de/gecko) is a research institution of [Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/de) and conducts research and development at the interfaces between medicine, economics and computer science. The DSF is part of Prof. Fegeler's research area: Interoperability and Digital Processes in Medicine. Other areas of research include educational technologies, health economics, and consumer health informatics.


### University of Heidelberg | Institute of Medical Informatics 
The [Institute of Medical Informatics](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/kliniken-institute/institute/institut-fuer-medizinische-informatik) belongs to the University of Heidelberg. The scientific focus of the institute is on structured patient data, e.g. 
- in the Medical Data Integration Center (MeDIC), 
- structured acquisition and transformation of biomedical data, 
- medical information systems and data models 
- and much more.


### University of Leipzig | LIFE Institute 
The [LIFE Institute](https://www.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/einrichtungen/life/) of the University of Leipzig manages collaborative and follow-on projects in the fields of medicine, public health, medical informatics, and biobanking.

## Public Funding
### Medical Informatics Initiative: "Data Sharing Framework Community" (2023-2026)


![BMBF Logo =228x158](/photos/learnmore/funding/bmbf.png) 

 The DSF Community connects the DSF competencies of the entire [Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/de/start) so that new use cases, in particular from Module 3 or the [Network University Medicine (NUM)](https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de/), are better supported in creating the respective DSF plugins. In the context of Module 2b, the DSF Community contributes to the further development of the common digital infrastructure of the MII together with the [FDPG+](https://forschen-fuer-gesundheit.de/) and [TRANSIT](https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/transit-medizininformatik-struktur-data-management-unit-16148.php) projects. [BMBF](https://www.gesundheitsforschung-bmbf.de/de/dsf-medizininformatik-struktur-data-sharing-framework-community-16133.php)

 Heilbronn University (HHN) focuses on the connecting of DSF related topics and competencies in the MII with the community management. The quality assurance of new DSF plugins and further development of the application and core components aim at a scalable, stable and secure operation of the DSF (Funding code: 01ZZ2307A).

 Heidelberg University is focusing on the further development of the DSF core components as well as the rollout of the DSF plugins, in particular also from the perspective of a data integration center in consultation with the FDGP+ and TRANSIT projects (Funding code: 01ZZ2307B).

 The University of Leipzig will further develop and adapt the DSF plugin for the Research Data Portal for Health FDPG according to specifications resulting from the FDPG+ project and enable Data Integration Centers (DIC) to operate the FDPG plugin (Funding code: 01ZZ2307C).

### Medical Informatics Initiative: HiGHmed consortium (2018-2022)

[HiGHmed](https://www.highmed.org/en/home) aims to increase the efficiency of clinical research and improve patient care through new medical informatics solutions and cross-organizational data exchange. The concept will be developed on the basis of three defined prototypical use cases, which will ensure close integration with the requirements of patient care and medical research. The [GECKO Institute](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/de/gecko) of HHN will establish a trusted third party with pseudonymization service to implement the goals of HiGHmed and is involved in the technical development of the DSF together with the partners (Funding code: 01ZZ1802E). Heidelberg University is in particular involved in the technical development of the DSF (Funding code: 01ZZ1802A).
