The German Society for Medical Informatics, Biometry, and Epidemiology e.V. (GMDS) is an independent scientific and medical society with over 2,000 members. At the GMDS conference, the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) was presented, accompanied by a tutorial on implementing Process Plugins for DSF version 0.9.x.

::: warning Outdated Tutorial
Please note that the version presented was designed for DSF < 1.0.0 and that namespaces and other aspects have changed since then. A more recent version of the Tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-tutorial).

The tutorial is divided into several exercises that build on each other. For each exercise, a sample solution is provided in a separate branch. A recording of the opening remarks by H. Hund and R. Wettstein can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2AUPwQQQsPY?si=r1tWF3-q3Q4paYef). The slides of the opening remarks are available as a [PDF download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highmed/dsf-process-tutorial/main/exercises/figures/2022-08-21_GMDS_2022_DSF_Process_Tutorial.pdf).
