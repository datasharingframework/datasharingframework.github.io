### Which value does the extraction and research of routine data provide?
- Efficiency: Routine data can be used to conduct research more efficiently and cost-effectively. Instead of collecting new data, researchers can analyze existing data to answer research questions, saving time and resources.

- Generalizability: Routine data can provide a large and diverse sample of patients, increasing the generalizability of research findings. Since routine data is collected from a wide range of patients and settings, it can provide a more representative sample than studies that recruit a specific patient population.

- Longitudinal analysis: Routine data is collected over time, which allows researchers to conduct longitudinal research and track changes in patient outcomes over time. This can provide valuable insights into the natural history of diseases, treatments' effectiveness, and healthcare policies' impact.
