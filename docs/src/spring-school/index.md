## Preparation
Please bring your laptop (min. 16 GB RAM) that you can use for development. As in previous years, we have set up tables with monitors (HDMI) where you can work.

If you want to participate in the Plugin Tutorial process, it would be great if you could complete [“Exercise 0”](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-tutorial/blob/main/exercises/exercise-0.md) before you arrive so that we can ideally start directly with content task 1. If this is no longer possible, we will be happy to help you set up during the event.
