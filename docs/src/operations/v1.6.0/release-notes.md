### 1.6.0 - Improved Update Performance
General remarks:
- This is an update for the 1.x DSF and not compatible with 0.9.x and older version developed at [highmed/highmed-dsf](https://github.com/highmed/highmed-dsf).
- To Update an existing 1.x installation, please see the [1.x -> 1.6.0 Upgrade Guide](https://dsf.dev/v1.6.0/maintain/upgrade-from-1.html).
- For a fresh deployment, follow the [installation instructions](https://dsf.dev/v1.6.0/maintain/install.html).
- With this release, library dependencies have been updated, a number of bugs fixed and the execution of FHIR update operations for `Organization` and `OrganizationAffiliation` improved.

Known Issue:
- Duplicate `ActivityDefinition` resources in DSF FHIR server prevent processes from being executed, for more infos and a workaround see [#247](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/issues/247)

Features:
- The execution performance of FHIR rest update operations for `Organization` and `OrganizationAffiliation` resource has been improved.

Bug Fixes:
- The DSF BPE missed `Task` and `QuestionnaireResponse` resources received by the DSF FHIR server during a connection outage between the DSF FHIR and DSF BPE servers. Missed `Task` and `QuestionnaireResponse` are now always downloded after the connection is reestablished. See [#233](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/issues/233)
- The OIDC provider URL could not be configured as a "no proxy" URL if a general forward proxy was configured for the DSF FHIR or DSF BPE servers. The responsible logic error in the code was fixed. See [#232](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/issues/232)
- `QuestionnaireResponse` and corresponding `Questionnaire` resource could not be created together in a `transaction` `Bundle`. The reference check for the `QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire` canoncial reference was move to the correct `transaction` `Bundle` execution phase. See [#226](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/issues/226)
- A wrong resource type in the `getLocalVersionlessAbsoluteUrl` method of the plugin API class `QuestionnaireResponseHelperImpl` was fixed. See [#224](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/issues/224)
