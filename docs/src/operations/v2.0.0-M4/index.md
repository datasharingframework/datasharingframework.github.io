### DSF 2 Dependency Updates: Transitioning from Camunda 7 to Operaton
As part of the upcoming DSF 2 release, several internal dependencies will be updated. Where appropriate, some components will also be replaced with more sustainable alternatives to ensure long-term maintainability and support.

One significant change involves the replacement of Camunda 7 Community Edition. As its support is scheduled to end in autumn 2025, DSF 2 will be delivered with an alternative BPMN engine. According to the current planning status, this will be [Operaton](https://operaton.org/), an open-source BPMN engine with an active development community.

For users of DSF 1, a final release will be made available that includes the last supported version of Camunda 7 CE, allowing for continued use without immediate migration.
