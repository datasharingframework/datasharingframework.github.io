This error occurs if a host name cannot be mapped to an IP address. Either because of a spelling mistake of the host name or because of DNS problems. If this happens in the context of a DSF process, it is recommended to review the configuration of the process plugin or contact the process plugin's maintainers in case of the former. DNS problems have a wide variety of sources and usually have to be resolved on the side of the sender.
