You can read all about the concept of Allow Lists [here](/intro/info/allowList.md).

## Overview
To simplify the Allow List Management we have built a portal for administration. On this portal, managed by the Gecko Institute of Heilbronn University, you as an administrator can create or update your Allow List. The information you provide on this portal will only be transferred to us. To access the site you need the certificate of your organization.
Initially, the Allow List Management Tool is only for DSF test infrastructure. For production, please write us an <a href="mailto:dsf-gecko@hs-heilbronn.de">E-Mail</a>.

## Prerequisites
1. Deployed DSF instance (test infrastructure)
    1.1  If none exists yet, read [here](install)
2. Certificate 
    2.1  If none exists yet, read [here](install#client-server-certificates)
3. Organization identifier (FQDN of your organization, e.g. *hs-heilbronn.de*)
4. FHIR Endpoint URL (e.g. *https://gth.gecko.hs-heilbronn.de/fhir* )
5. Contact details from a responsible person of your organization
6. Access to the E-Mail address from your organization for verification 
 

## Start [here](TODO)
When you have fulfilled all the prerequisites, you can start managing your Allow Lists. 
At the beginning, a popup will appear where you have to select your certificate. Only then you will have access to the website. [www.dsf-allowlistmgm.de](TODO)
