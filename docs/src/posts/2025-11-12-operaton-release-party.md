On Friday, November 21st, 2025, Hauke Hund and Maximilian Kurscheidt from the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) team will be attending the Operaton Release Party at the itemis headquarters in Dortmund to celebrate the upcoming release of [Operaton 1.0](https://operaton.org/).

During the event, Hauke will give a talk, titled **“Migration Experiences from Camunda 7 to Operaton for DSF 2.0”,** which will take place from **17:30 to 17:50** and will focus on our experience transitioning from Camunda 7 to Operaton.

The event promises to be an exciting opportunity to network and meet the Operaton community face-to-face for the first time. We’re looking forward connecting with everyone!

Alongside our presentation, other participants will also give short talks. If you’re curious about the topics covered, you can view the full event details on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7377335371619024896/)**.
