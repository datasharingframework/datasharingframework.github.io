On Friday, November 21st, 2025, Hauke Hund and Maximilian Kurscheidt from the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) team attended the Operaton Release Party at the itemis headquarters in Dortmund to celebrate the upcoming release of  [Operaton 1.0](https://operaton.org/).

During the event, Hauke gave a talk titled **“Migration Experiences from Camunda 7 to Operaton for DSF 2.0”**, which took place from 17:30 to 17:50 and focused on our experience transitioning from Camunda 7 to Operaton.

The event was an exciting opportunity to network and meet the Operaton community face-to-face for the first time. We were delighted to meet the community and the core contributors.We would like to thank everyone for the great event. 

Alongside our presentation, other participants also gave short talks. If you’re curious about the topics that were covered, you can view the full event details on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7377335371619024896/)**.
