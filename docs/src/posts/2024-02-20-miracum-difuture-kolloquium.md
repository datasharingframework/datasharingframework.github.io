## Miracum Difuture Kolloquium 2024

On February 20, 2024, the DSF team had the opportunity to present the Data Sharing Framework (DSF) Community Project at the MIRACUM-DIFUTURE Colloquium. The aim of the MIRACUM-DIFUTURE  Colloquium is to promote knowledge exchange and enable project participants to gain foundational and advanced insights into key topics by having experts present methods, techniques, tools, processes, and frameworks.

During the presentation, the DSF team highlighted the role of the framework within the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII). The DSF is a federated research data infrastructure developed to support the secondary use of routine medical data. 

The primary goal of the presentation was to provide a foundational understanding of the DSF’s architecture and operational principles. The DSF was conceptualized as a secure middleware based on standardized communication protocols, information models, and widely adopted standards such as HL7 FHIR, BPMN 2.0, and X.509 client and server certificates. In addition, Maximilian Kurscheidt demonstrated distributed data sharing processes and showcased real-world use cases implemented with the DSF. The talk illustrated obstacles and challenges the DSF community had to overcome.
