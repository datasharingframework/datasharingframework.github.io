The **DSF Community Hackathon**, held on **January 20, 2026**, focused on supporting organisations that run the DSF in adopting the new [**DSF 2.0.1**](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf/releases/tag/v2.0.1) release. The event kicked off with presentations by Hauke Hund on DSF 2.0 and API 2.0, the Ping Pong plugin by Jan Böhringer, followed by further support sessions and announcements e.g. for the [**Spring School 2026**](https://dsf.dev/spring-school/).

The event attracted **over 60 participants**, who actively took part in the online hackathon. The event provided direct, hands-on assistance for migrating existing setups to the newest DSF version and updating the required MII process plugins. 

To support each location, we offered individual breakout rooms for direct assistance. The format of the event was an overall success. At the end of the Hackathon **17 Organizations** are now running the DSF 2.0.1 release in production, and **over 20 locations** are running it in their test environments. Other organizations will follow up on the migration in the coming weeks.

We like to thank all participants for joining and participating in the Hackathon. Regarding the feedback the  hackathon helped to ease the transition to **DSF 2.0.1**. We are looking forward to see you at our next community event.
