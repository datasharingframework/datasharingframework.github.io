The DSF uses BPMN 2.0 to model processes. Specifically, the [Camunda 7](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.20/) dialect from the [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/de/download/modeler/). Modeling processes for the DSF requires this modeler or any other modeler which is able to produce the correct Camunda dialect.
