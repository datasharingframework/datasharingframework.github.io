::: tip Work in progress
We are currently in the process of updating the written documentation on how to create a DSF process plugin. 

In the meantime, we recommend exploring these example DSF processes:

- The [hello world plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-hello-world)
- The [ping pong plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-ping-pong)
- The [update allowlist plugin](https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-process-allow-list)
