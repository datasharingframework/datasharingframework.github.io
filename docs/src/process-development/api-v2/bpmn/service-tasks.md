## Service Tasks

One of the most common types of BPMN Tasks used for modeling DSF processes is the [Service Task](https://docs.operaton.org/docs/documentation/reference/bpmn20/tasks/service-task). They are different from regular BPMN Tasks in that they offer the ability to link a Java class to the [Service Task](https://docs.operaton.org/docs/documentation/reference/bpmn20/tasks/service-task) which can be called and executed by a BPMN engine. The BPE (Business Process Engine) server of the DSF leverages this engine to execute BPMN processes and their associated code.
