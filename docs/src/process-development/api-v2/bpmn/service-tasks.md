## Service Tasks

One of the most common types of BPMN Tasks used for modeling DSF processes is the [Service Task](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.21/reference/bpmn20/tasks/service-task/). They are different from regular BPMN Tasks in that they offer the ability to link an implementation to the [Service Task](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.21/reference/bpmn20/tasks/service-task/) which can be called and executed by a BPMN engine. The BPE (Business Process Engine) server of the DSF leverages this engine to execute BPMN processes.
