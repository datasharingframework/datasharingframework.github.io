## Execution Listeners

[Execution Listeners](https://docs.operaton.org/docs/documentation/user-guide/model-api/bpmn-model-api/delegation-code/#execution-listener) can be registered to various flow elements like process, events, tasks, gateways and sequence flows. They are called when the process execution arrives at the flow element they are registered to.
