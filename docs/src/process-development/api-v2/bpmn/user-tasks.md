### User Tasks

User Tasks define a process step that requires some kind of human interaction. Usually this is done by providing some kind of form the user can fill out. The Camunda Modeler allows to configure these forms as either a propriatary format called [Camunda Forms](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/utilizing-forms/) or custom forms called `Embedded or External Task Forms`. The DSF uses such `External Task Forms` in the form of [Questionnaire](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaire.html) and [Questionnaire Response](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/questionnaireresponse.html) resources. This mechanism is further expanded upon in [User Tasks in the DSF](../guides/user-tasks-in-the-dsf.md).
