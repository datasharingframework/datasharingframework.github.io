It utilizes BPMN 2.0 and FHIR R4 standards to support processes such as data extraction, merging, pseudonymization, and provisioning. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Medical Informatics initiative, the DSF aims to improve data interoperability and security across institutional boundaries.</p><h2 id="key-features-and-benefits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features-and-benefits"><span>Key features and benefits</span></a></h2><h3 id="distributed-data-sharing-processes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-data-sharing-processes"><span>Distributed data sharing processes</span></a></h3><p>DSF enables distributed data sharing by providing each participating site with a FHIR endpoint and a business process engine.
