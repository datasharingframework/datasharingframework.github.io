A researcher can use the DSF for example to submit feasibility queries to several DICs and thus has the opportunity to obtain sufficient data from different locations for his or her research. By using international standards such as FHIR and BPMN 2.0, the problem of heterogeneous data models, primary systems, architectures and federated legislation between DICs can be solved. The aim is to enable secure and syntactically-, semantically- and process-interoperable data exchange across organisational boundaries.</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="DSF concept" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>DSF concept</figcaption></figure><p>The DSF is a secure communication infrastructure, that (1) scales with communication relationships, (2) orchestrates processes and instances, (3) separates execution logic from program code, (4) enables automated and user-centeric process steps ​(5) and can be used for heterogeny structures.</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="Federated data exchange between distributed DICs (CRP=Central Research Portal, DMU=Data Management Unit)" width="500" height="320" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Federated data exchange between distributed DICs (CRP=Central Research Portal, DMU=Data Management Unit)</figcaption></figure>',7)])])}const f=i(c,[["render",d]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/explore/concepts/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","icon":"customize"},"git":{"createdTime":1690473388000,"updatedTime":1764347480000,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Mödinger","username":"","email":"smoeding@stud.hs-heilbronn.de","commits":4},{"name":"Serap Aydin","username":"","email":"saydin3@stud.hs-heilbronn.de","commits":5}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.06,"words":319},"filePathRelative":"explore/concepts/introduction.md","excerpt":"<p>The <a href=\\"https://www.bmftr.bund.de/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space</a> is funding the <a href=\\"https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/start\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">Medical Informatics Initiative</a> with the aim of making routine data available digitally, reliably and quickly for medical research.
