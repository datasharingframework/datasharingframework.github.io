The event offered us a valuable opportunity to share our insights and lessons learned from implementing and working with FHIR in various contexts such as the DSF and the International Patient Summary (IPS).</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="FHIR DevDays2025" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>FHIR DevDays2025</figcaption></figure><h3 id="community-talk-fostering-research-with-fhir-and-bpmn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-talk-fostering-research-with-fhir-and-bpmn"><span>Community Talk: Fostering Research with FHIR and BPMN</span></a></h3><p>On the last day of the conference, Hauke Hund presented lesson learned from the DSF in his talk “Fostering Research: Real-World Data Sharing and Process Orchestration with FHIR and BPMN”. In this session, Hauke shared valuable lessons learned from the implementation, rollout, and maintenance of different DSF networks. The talk illustrated how combining <strong>FHIR</strong> with Business Process Model and Notation (<strong>BPMN</strong> 2.0) enables secure, automated, scalable sharing of real-world research data across institutional boundaries.</p><p><strong>Slides from this talk can be viewed here: <a href="/assets/presentations/250606_HaukeHund_DataSharingFramework_fsh.pdf">Fostering Research with FHIR and BPMN</a></strong></p><h3 id="birds-of-a-feather-session-fhir-and-terminology-validation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#birds-of-a-feather-session-fhir-and-terminology-validation"><span>Birds of a Feather Session: FHIR and Terminology Validation</span></a></h3><p>On Thursday, we hosted a spontaneous deep-dive session on FHIR and terminology validation, which proved to be a great success, sparking lively discussions and active engagement among participants. With over 70 registrations and 35 attendees, the session underscored the significance of this topic within the FHIR community.</p><p>The session explored how terminology validation can be integrated into current workflows and it shed light on common challenges and limitations of existing FHIR validators. The dicsussion also included ideas for future improvements and their potential for wider adoption of FHIR validation tools.</p><p>This session served as a valuable preparation for the upcoming MII validation workshop. <strong>If you&#39;re interested, you can find more information here in german: <a href="https://www.tmf-ev.de/news/fhir-validierungs-workshop-bei-der-tmf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FHIR Validation Workshop</a></strong></p><p><strong>Following the event, the DSF Validator was published and is available at: <a href="https://github.com/datasharingframework/dsf-fhir-validator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DSF FHIR Validator</a></strong></p><h3 id="community-talk-international-patient-summary-ips-challenge-2025" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#community-talk-international-patient-summary-ips-challenge-2025"><span>Community Talk: International Patient Summary (IPS) Challenge 2025</span></a></h3><p>On Tuesday, we hosted a community talk focused on the International Patient Summary (IPS) Challenge 2025. The IPS is a standardized set of clinical data that provides a concise overview of a patient’s current health status. As part of the challenge, students from Heilbronn University and the Universidad de Chile collaborated to implement and demonstrate IPS-based use cases.</p><p>Participants in the challenge had the opportunity to present their work at the HL7 Chile Connectathon. The FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) was used as the basis for five demonstrators. The use cases focused on providing medical summaries for patients with conditions such as hypertension, food intolerance, post-surgical history, diabetes, and asthma, with a particular focus on cross-border care scenarios</p><p>Maximilian Kurscheidt shared our insights and lessons learned from this initiative. Topics included challenges in cross-border IPS data exchange, effective visualization of longitudinal health records, and the complexities of translating FHIR resources and medical terminologies across languages and systems. The talk also addressed handling medical imaging within the IPS and compared general-purpose IPS viewers with use case-specific applications.</p><p><strong>Slides from this talk can be viewed here: <a href="/assets/presentations/250603_maximiliankurscheidt_ips_challenge.pdf">International Patient Summary Challenge 2025</a></strong></p><p>FHIR DevDays 2025 was an excellent opportunity to showcase our work, gain valuable insights, and engage with the global FHIR community. We extend our sincere thanks to the organizers and to everyone who participated in our talks and discussions. We truly appreciated the chance to connect with fellow experts and look forward to continuing the dialogue on interoperability, research, and innovation in digital health innovation.</p><img src="'+s+'" alt="FHIR" style="width:100%;height:auto;"> Group picture of german participants on FHIR DEVDays.
