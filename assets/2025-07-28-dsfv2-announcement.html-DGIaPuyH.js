A central element of this release is a revised API for process plugins, designed to simplify and accelerate the development of custom plugins for individual use cases.</p><p>According to the current development status, <strong>DSF 2 will remain backwards compatible with DSF 1</strong>. Existing process plugins are expected to continue functioning, and compatibility with current DSF versions is intended.</p><p>In addition to the new API, DSF 2 will include a range of enhancements:</p><ul><li>Upgrade to the latest versions of Java, Jetty, Spring, HAPI, and other core dependencies</li><li>Support for large binary resources (currently tested with files of approx. 250GiB)</li><li>Improved and streamlined process plugin API</li><li>Numerous internal optimizations for increased performance and stability (including improved logging and simplified configuration of external FHIR servers)</li></ul><p>A <strong>test release of DSF 2</strong> is scheduled for fall of this year, with <strong>general availability for production use</strong> planned by the end of the year. A milestone release is already available for preview purposes; however, both the API and feature set are subject to change prior to the final release.</p><p>Following the production release of DSF 2, further development of DSF 1 will be discontinued. Until then, at least one additional DSF 1 release is planned.</p><p>The new API V2 is particularly relevant for stakeholders involved in the development of custom process plugins. Feedback and contributions to the ongoing development are welcome.</p><p>Any changes to the current timeline will be communicated promptly.</p>',10)])])}const c=t(i,[["render",o]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/2025-07-28-dsfv2-announcement.html","title":"DSF 2.0 Announcement","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"DSF 2.0 Announcement","date":"2025-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":"news","excerpt":"We’re excited to announce that the next major release, DSF 2.0, is currently in development!
