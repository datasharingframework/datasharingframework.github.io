With the upcoming DSF 2.0 release, we are transitioning our business process engine from Camunda 7 to <a href="https://github.com/operaton/operaton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operaton 1.0.0</a>. We are currently testing our application with the Operaton 1.0.0-beta-5 release based on Camunda 7.23. It’s now available for testing.

In some cases, components are being replaced with more sustainable alternatives to ensure long-term maintainability and support. One of the most significant changes is the replacement of Camunda 7 Community Edition, whose official support will end in autumn 2025.</p><p>To secure the future of DSF, we are moving to <a href="https://operaton.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operaton</a>, a modern and open-source BPMN 2.0 engine backed by an active development community. Operaton aligns well with DSF’s distributed, peer-to-peer architecture and will strengthen performance, scalability, and long-term maintainability. Just as important, Operaton’s commitment to being fully free and open source reflects the core values of the DSF community.</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-dsf-users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-this-means-for-dsf-users"><span>What this means for DSF users</span></a></h2><ul><li>DSF 2.0 will ship with Operaton as the default BPMN engine.</li><li>DSF 1 users will receive a final release including the last supported version of Camunda 7 CE, ensuring continued use without immediate migration.</li><li>We encourage developers and users to test the milestone release and share feedback to help refine the transition.</li></ul><p>We will keep the community informed and share further updates as DSF 2.0 moves toward release.</p>',8)])])}const h=t(i,[["render",o]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/2025-10-02-operaton-DSF-2.0.html","title":"Operaton testing with DSF 2.0-4M","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Operaton testing with DSF 2.0-4M","date":"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":"news","excerpt":"The Data Sharing Framework (DSF) is entering an exciting new phase.
