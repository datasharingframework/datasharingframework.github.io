<p>The <strong>Data Sharing Framework (DSF)</strong> is a secure middleware solution designed to facilitate data sharing across different organizations for biomedical research. It utilizes BPMN 2.0 and FHIR R4 standards to support processes such as data extraction, merging, pseudonymization, and provisioning. Funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Medical Informatics initiative, the DSF aims to improve data interoperability and security across institutional boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-data-sharing-processes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-data-sharing-processes"><span>Distributed data sharing processes</span></a></h3>
<p>DSF enables distributed data sharing by providing each participating site with a FHIR endpoint and a business process engine. This setup ensures that data can be securely shared and processed across different sites, facilitating cross-site data sharing and feasibility analyses.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility-with-data-standards" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#flexibility-with-data-standards"><span>Flexibility with data standards</span></a></h3>
<p>While DSF primarily uses the FHIR R4 standard to ensure high-quality data exchange, it is designed to be open and adaptable to other data formats. This flexibility allows for a wide range of data types to be incorporated into research projects.</p>
<h3 id="security-and-access-control" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-and-access-control"><span>Security and access control</span></a></h3>
<p>Security is a critical component of DSF, which includes robust authentication and authorization protocols. These protocols ensure that data access and sharing are restricted to authorized organizations, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-in-clinical-environments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deployment-in-clinical-environments"><span>Deployment in clinical environments</span></a></h3>
<p>DSF is already deployed and operational in <em>Data Integration Centers</em>  at German university hospitals, demonstrating its applicability and reliability in real-world clinical research settings.</p>
